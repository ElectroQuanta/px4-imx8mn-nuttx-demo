* Preamble
1. Run the build script which:
   1. Builds PX4
   2. Builds U-Boot and ATF and downloads the board's firmware
   3. Creates a bootable image for the board
      #+begin_src bash
	make -C $MKIMG SOC=iMX8MN flash_ddr3l_val_no_hdmi
      #+end_src
      1. Watch out for this target, as this is ~ddr3l~-based
      2. Setup accordingly if the board does not boot properly
   4. Deploys to the SD card
